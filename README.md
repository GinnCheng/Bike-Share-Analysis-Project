### Project Title
**Bike Share Analysis**

### Description
This project is part of the **Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree** program. It involves analysing bike share data from three cities (***Chicago***, ***New York***, and ***Washington***) to uncover trends and insights. The `bikeshare.py` script allows users to interactively explore data such as *trip duration*, *user statistics*, and *popular routes* in categorised by the user-defined inputs such as _year_, _month_, and _day_ across the three cities, through a command-line interface. The analysis provides valuable information for bike share companies to optimise operations and improve user experience.
